Learning Haskell out of curiosity.

Practising the problems as in here: https://wiki.haskell.org/H-99:_Ninety-Nine_Haskell_Problems using the REPL.IT platform. Please forgive my newbie style of coding. There might be superfluous pattern matching statements. 
Suggestions and corrections are welcome.
